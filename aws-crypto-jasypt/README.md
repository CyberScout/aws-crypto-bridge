## Jasypt Integration and Bridge

This module provides an integration of the AWS Encryption SDK into Jasypt. It
also provides "transitional" integrations, which support decrypt existing data
using the original mechanism, but encrypting data using the ESDK.

See the package-level JavaDoc comments for more information.
